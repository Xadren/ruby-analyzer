# ruby-analyzer

A simple text file analyzer written in Ruby. Execute from command line with ```ruby analyzer.rb path/to/file.txt```

If you want a really simple and unhelpful summary of the text file, use ```ruby analyzer.rb path/to/file.txt -s```

There are three files included for you to play try.

First is _oliver.txt_ which contains the first chapter of Oliver Twist. Second is _hamlet.txt_ which contains Act 1 Scene 1 of Hamlet. Finally, there is _rj.txt_ which contains the full text of Romeo and Juliet.
